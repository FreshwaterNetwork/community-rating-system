	<h3>Impact Adjusted Special Flood Hazard Area</h3>
	<p>The extent of the areas eligible for consideration of Open Space Preservation credits based on criteria outlined in the 2017 CRS manual. Areas excluded are: all Federal Lands > 10 ac, open waters > 10 ac, rivers with average bank-to-bank width >500 ft, and all areas outside of FEMA's 100 yr floodplain.</p>
	<h3>Open Space Preservation (422a)</h3>
	<p>Parcels that are eligible for Open Space Preservation credit based on their current land use or because they contribute to a regulatory setback area. Although the entire parcel is highlighted on the map, only the portion of the parcel that meets the requirements for eligibility is included in the OSP credit calculation. Parcels on vacant land are ONLY eligible if they are undeveloped, are not used as storage, and will be left as open space for at least 5 years. Local expertise is recommended to verify if the parcels identified by this app meet these qualifications prior to applying for OSP points</p>.
	<h3>Natural Functioning Open Space (422c)</h3>
	<p>Natural Functioning Open Space provides additional credit for parcels that are already eligible for Open Space Preservation credit AND the area is preserved in or restored to its natural state AND has been designated as ecologically valuable. Natural Heritage data were used to determine OSP areas that overlapped known occurrences of species designated by the state as endangered, threatened, or of special concern. Although the entire parcel is highlighted on the map, only the portion of the parcel that meets the requirements for OSP and NFOS eligibility is included in the NFOS credit calculation. Local expertise is recommended to verify if the parcels identified by this app meet these qualifications prior to applying for NFOS points.</p>
