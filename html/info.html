	<h3>Impact Adjusted Special Flood Hazard Area</h3>
	<p>The extent of the areas eligible for consideration of Open Space Preservation credits based on criteria outlined in the 2017 CRS manual. Areas excluded are: all Federal Lands > 10 ac, open waters > 10 ac, rivers with average bank-to-bank width >500 ft, and all areas outside of FEMA's 100 yr floodplain.</p>
	<h3>Open Space Preservation (422a)</h3>
	<p>Parcels that are eligible for Open Space Preservation credit based on their current land use or because they contribute to a regulatory setback area. Although the entire parcel is highlighted on the map, only the portion of the parcel that meets the requirements for eligibility is included in the OSP credit calculation. Parcels on vacant land are ONLY eligible if they are undeveloped, are not used as storage, and will be left as open space for at least 5 years. Local expertise is recommended to verify if the parcels identified by this app meet these qualifications prior to applying for OSP points</p>
	<h3>Natural Functioning Open Space (422c)</h3>
	<p>Natural Functioning Open Space provides additional credit for parcels that are already eligible for Open Space Preservation credit AND the area is preserved in or restored to its natural state AND has been designated as ecologically valuable. Natural Heritage data were used to determine OSP areas that overlapped known occurrences of species designated by the state as endangered, threatened, or of special concern. Although the entire parcel is highlighted on the map, only the portion of the parcel that meets the requirements for OSP and NFOS eligibility is included in the NFOS credit calculation. Local expertise is recommended to verify if the parcels identified by this app meet these qualifications prior to applying for NFOS points.</p>
	<h3>Future Potential Open Space</h3>
	<p>Areas within the impact adjusted special flood hazard area that have natural land uses but are not currently eligible for OSP simply because they are not legally protected from development. Privately owned parcels are prioritized because they are easier to acquire and/or establish easements with landowners. Natural land cover types include forests, wetlands, grasslands, and pasture. Resulting parcels are then filtered by those that could provide at least 1 OSP credit if protected.</p>
	<h3>Excluded Areas</h3>
	<p>Areas not eligible for OSP 420 activity per the 2017 CRS Manual and are extracted from the special flood hazard area. National hydrography database used to extract water bodies greater than 10 acres and rivers with average bank widths greater than 500ft. Protected Areas Database of the U.S. used to extract federally or tribally owned or managed areas greater than 10 acres.</p>
	<h3>Critical Species Habitat</h3>
	<p>Highlights ranges for threatened or endangered species to help prioritize future protected areas that could accommodate expansion of critical habitat for these species and may have the potential to qualify for extra credit under the Natural Functions Open Space 422c activity.  Source: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service threatened and endangered species dataset.</p>
	<h3>Wetland Restoration Potential</h3>
	<p>Highlights areas that have enabling conditions for wetland restoration to help prioritize future protected areas that could provide multiple benefits like wetland habitat, water quality, marsh migration due to sea level rise, and recreation if protected and restored.
